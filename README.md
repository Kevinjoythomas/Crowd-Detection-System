# 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️ Crowd Detection System 🛑👥

Welcome to the **Crowd Detection System**! This project uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** to detect people in real-time and raises alerts when the crowd exceeds a configurable threshold. It also saves images of the crowd based on a time gap provided in the configuration file.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Detect People**:  
   YOLO detects people in the input feed (video or images).

2. **Threshold Alert**:  
   If the number of people detected exceeds the threshold in the provided `config.yaml` file, the system raises an alert.

3. **Save Snapshots**:  
   Snapshots of the crowded scenes are saved at intervals defined in the configuration file.
